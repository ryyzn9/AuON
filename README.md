# AuON
AuON( Alternative Unit-norm momentum-updates by Normal- ized nonlinear scaling), a linear-time optimizer that achieves remarkable perfor- mance at linear time without producing semi-orthogonal matrices while preserving structure to guide better-aligned progress and recondition ill-posed updates.
